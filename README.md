## Please note

- I have added an option for people use a qb-menu styled car control menu, Wanted to try and implement new items in the qb-menu section of things out there..

- Please make sure you use the latest qb-core & qb-menu in order for this to work.

- This Script was tested on the latest build as of 12/11/2021.

## Soon To Come | Planned Updates

- Next Version Release - 

Plans to be added in next few updates - 
`Will be looking for a way to figure out how to keep the qb-menu Menu up after selection for doors, windows, and seats`
`Will Add Job Check for PD/EMS/Mechanic for Car Livery Selection and Extras Built In`
`Will Add Vehicle Examination For Mechanics`
`Will Add Neon Lights if Owned Turn On & Off`
`Will Look into Adding Examination for PD as well to see if vehicle is modified for racing - i.e, Nos, Turbo`

## if you want to combine it in to an already made resource like qb-smallresources just rename "main.lua" to "cl_carcontrol.lua" and add make sure to add it in--> @qb-smallresources --> client / update as well as update the fxmanifest of qb-smallresources, if you do this.

`To add qb-carcontrol in to your Radial Menu, open qb-radialmenu/config.lua file and (Add+) this snippet below into the config file under the vehicle section. It will open the qb-carcontrol menu while you are in a vehicle. `
```
       	   {
                id = 'vehiclemenu',
                title = 'Car Control',
                icon = 'bars',
                type = 'client',
                event = 'ccvehmenu:client:openMenu',
                shouldClose = true
            }
```
